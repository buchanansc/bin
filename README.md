# Shell scripts

Drop this directory anywhere in your bash environment. Then add the following to
your `.bash_profile` 

	source ~/path/to/this/bash_profile.sh

You will then be treated to a soft pillowy cushion of a bash environment, where
the scripts run wild and free. A place where aliases can grow into the functions
they were destined to be. No command is without merit, every keystroke a work of
art, waiting to be tresured.

You are home now.
